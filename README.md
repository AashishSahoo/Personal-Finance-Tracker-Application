Personal Finance Tracker Application



This project is a Personal Finance Tracker Application built to help users manage their income, expenses, and savings goals. The application includes features such as secure user authentication, financial transaction management, and integration with financial data APIs. It uses React.js, Redux, and Material-UI to provide a modern, responsive, and intuitive user interface.

Objective
The goal of this project is to provide a practical hands-on experience with:

Developing a full-featured financial tracker using React.js.
Implementing user authentication and secure routing.
Managing global state using Redux for efficient handling of financial data.
Using Material-UI for responsive and modern UI design.
Integrating with a financial data API to enhance the application's functionality.

Features
User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login functionality. Authentication tokens are stored securely, and routes are protected based on user login status.
Financial Data Management: Users can track their income, expenses, and savings using a simple interface. Financial transactions are stored and managed in Redux, with options to add, edit, and delete transactions.
API Integration: Integration with a financial data API (e.g., currency exchange rates) to provide real-time financial insights.
Dashboard Overview: A visually appealing dashboard shows total income, expenses, balance, and progress towards savings goals.
Transaction Management: A dedicated section to add, edit, and categorize financial transactions.
Savings Goals: Users can set and track savings goals, with visual indicators of progress.
Dark Mode: Optional dark mode functionality using Material-UI theming.

Technologies Used
React.js (v18+): For building the UI components and managing the application's state.
Redux: For global state management and handling complex state changes.
Material-UI (MUI): To ensure a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
React Router: For implementing secure routing and navigation.
Financial Data API: Integration to fetch real-time financial information.
